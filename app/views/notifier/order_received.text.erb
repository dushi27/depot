Hello <%=@order.name%>,<br><br> 
<%=%>  
Thank you for trying the order feature of the Book-Z, a demo online store application built using Ruby on Rails. You are reciving this message because you have test ordered following products;
<%=%>
  <%@order.line_items.each do |item|%>
  <%=item.quantity%> x <%=Product.find(item.id)%>
  <%end%>
<%=%>
Please feel free to try out Book-Z API and the Admin interfaces at bookz.herokuapp.com

Regards,
